# LINO Stake(LS)

Different from LINO, LS is designed for long-term supporters of the network. LS is a feature designed in the Lino blockchain whereby, by staking LINO into LS, holders can

1. participate in the governance system and propose and vote on parameter changes and system upgrade proposals.

2. become an App developer, or a validator.

The ownership of the Lino blockchain is expected to become more decentralized as more people hold LS. Major decisions will be voted on by LS holders under the governance system.

LS holders will be able to get Voting Rewards based on their contributions to the network when they vote on proposals (paid out daily from the 9.9% of all donations and paid subscriptions).

LINO can be converted to LS instantly. However, it will take 12 weeks, called the Pending Period, to convert LS back to LINO.
