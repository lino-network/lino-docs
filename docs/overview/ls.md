# LINO Stake(LS)

Different from LINO, LS is designed for long-term supporters of the network and is **non-transferrable**. LS is a feature designed in the Lino blockchain whereby, by staking LINO into LS, holders can

1. participate in the [governance system](../blockchain/governance.html) and propose and vote on parameter changes and system upgrade proposals.

2. vote on [validator election](../blockchain/validator.html).

3. become an [App developer](../blockchain/developer.html), or a [validator](../blockchain/validator.html).

The ownership of the Lino blockchain is expected to become more decentralized as more people hold LS. Major decisions will be voted on by LS holders under the governance system.

## Voting Rewards

LS holders will be able to get **Voting Rewards** based on their contributions to the network when they vote on proposals or validator election. Voting Rewards are paid out daily from the **9.9%** of donations and paid subscriptions on all Lino Apps.
