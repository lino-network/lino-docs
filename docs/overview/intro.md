# Introduction

The mission of Lino blockchain is to facilitate a **Value-sharing Content Economy** where content creators, viewers, and all other contributors are fully and fairly incentivized to maximize long-term economic growth in a sustainable way.

## LINO

The native digital cryptographically-secured utility token of the Lino blockchain (LINO) is a transferable representation of attributed functions specified in the protocol/code of the Lino blockchain, designed to play a major role in the functioning of the ecosystem on the Lino blockchain, and intended to be used solely as the primary utility token on the protocol/network.

LINO is a non-refundable functional utility token which will be used as the fundamental medium of exchange between participants on the Lino blockchain. The goal of introducing LINO is to provide a convenient and secure mode of payment and settlement between participants who interact within the ecosystem on the Lino blockchain, and it is not, and not intended to be, a medium of exchange accepted by the public (or a section of the public) as payment for goods or services or for the discharge of a debt.

LINO would also function as the economic incentives which will be consumed to encourage participants to contribute and maintain the Lino blockchain ecosystem. Users of the Lino blockchain and/or holders of LINO which did not actively participate will not receive any LINO incentives. They would be distributed to reward all ecosystem contributors with LINO, such as validators (for providing computing resources to produce blocks and validate transactions), content creators (for producing and publishing original content, including videos and live streams), App developers (for developing applications on the network) and Voters (for participating in voting and governance). LINO is an integral and indispensable part of the Lino blockchain, because without LINO, there would be no incentive for users to expend resources to participate in activities or provide services for the benefit of the entire ecosystem on the Lino blockchain.

You can access your LINO by registering an account on [Lino Wallet](https://account.lino.network).

> LINO does not in any way represent any shareholding, participation, right, title, or interest in the Foundation, the Distributor, its affiliates, or any other company, enterprise or undertaking, nor will LINO entitle token holders to any promise of fees, dividends, revenue, profits or investment returns, and are not intended to constitute securities in Singapore or any relevant jurisdiction. LINO may only be utilised on the Lino blockchain, and ownership of LINO carries no rights, express or implied, other than the right to use LINO as a means to enable usage of and interaction within the Lino blockchain.  In particular, it is highlighted that LINO: (a) is non-refundable and cannot be exchanged for cash (or its equivalent value in any other virtual currency) or any payment obligation by the Foundation, the Distributor or any affiliate; (b)	does not represent or confer on the token holder any right of any form with respect to the Foundation, the Distributor (or any of its affiliates), or its revenues or assets, including without limitation any right to receive future dividends, revenue, shares, ownership right or stake, share or security, any voting, distribution, redemption, liquidation, proprietary (including all forms of intellectual property or license rights), right to receive accounts, financial statements or other financial data, the right to requisition or participate in shareholder meetings, the right to nominate a director, or other financial or legal rights or equivalent rights, or intellectual property rights or any other form of participation in or relating to the Lino blockchain, the Foundation, the Distributor and/or their service providers; (c)	is not intended to represent any rights under a contract for differences or under any other contract the purpose or pretended purpose of which is to secure a profit or avoid a loss; (d) is not intended to be a representation of money (including electronic money), security, commodity, bond, debt instrument, unit in a collective investment scheme or any other kind of financial instrument or investment; (e) is not a loan to the Foundation, the Distributor or any of its affiliates, is not intended to represent a debt owed by the Foundation, the Distributor or any of its affiliates, and there is no expectation of profit; and (f) does not provide the token holder with any ownership or other interest in the Foundation, the Distributor or any of its affiliates. The contributions in the token sale will be held by the Distributor (or its affiliate) after the token sale, and contributors will have no economic or legal right over or beneficial interest in these contributions or the assets of that entity after the token sale. To the extent a secondary market or exchange for trading LINO does develop, it would be run and operated wholly independently of the Foundation, the Distributor, the sale of LINO and the Lino blockchain. Neither the Foundation nor the Distributor will create such secondary markets nor will either entity act as an exchange for LINO.


## Lino Blockchain Highlights

### Earn LINO While Watching on Lino Apps

Leveraging the [token-incentivized NDN](../blockchain/ndn.html), viewers can utilize their idle network bandwidth and computing resources to provide infrastructure to Lino blockchain while earning LINO as rewards at the same time. In other words, viewers will be able to earn while watching on Lino Apps.

### No Platform Cut

Apps utilizing the Lino blockchain do not take any cuts from direct payments between viewers and content creators. 90.1% of any consumption(donation, paid subscription, and etc) will directly go to content creators, while the rest 9.9% will reward [LINO Stake](../overview/ls.html) holders for voting.

### In-app Digital Asset (IDA)

An App developer on Lino blockchain can issue its own fixed price [IDA](../blockchain/ida.html) that can be used within that app only. Developers would be required to stake an amount of LINO before being entitled to develop applications. IDA, for the first time, makes blockchain-based applications more user-friendly to non-crypto users.

### Voting Rewards

[LINO Stake](../overview/ls.html) holders vote on [validator](../blockchain/validator.html) election as well as [governance proposals](../blockchain/governance.html), and receive [Voting Rewards](../overview/ls.html#voting-rewards) in return. The Voting Rewards come from 9.9% of all consumptions on Lino blockchain.

> For the avoidance of doubt, the right to vote is restricted solely to voting on features of the Lino blockchain; the right to vote does not entitle LINO holders to vote on the operation and management of the Foundation or its affiliates, or their assets, and does not constitute any equity interest in the Foundation or its affiliates).

### Decentralized Ownership

LINO Stake is the token which entitles participation in the Lino blockchain. LINO Stake holders will elect the validators and vote for the future updates to the features of Lino blockchain. By decentralizing the network participation, all contributors to Lino blockchain, including developers and content creators, will strive for the prosperity of the Lino ecosystem together.

## Consensus Algorithm

Lino blockchain is based on the Byzantine Fault Tolerance(BFT) based Proof-of-Stake(PoS) consensus algorithm, particularly the open source projects [Tendermint](https://tendermint.com/) and [Cosmos](https://cosmos.network/).
