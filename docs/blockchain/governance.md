# Governance

The Lino blockchain governance system is proposal based. There are several types of proposals. A certain amount of LS and security deposit are required for creating any proposals. The security deposit will be returned after the voting period of the proposal. LS holders can vote for any proposal with the weight of the amount of LS, and the votes cannot be changed.

In order to pass any proposal, both a minimum **Vote Rate** and a minimum **Approval Rate** have to be met. Vote rate is the effective votes(total LS amount of all voted accounts) out of all LS amount at the creation of the proposal. Approval Rate is the approval votes(LS amount of the accounts who voted approval) out of the effective votes.
