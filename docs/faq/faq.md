# Lino FAQ

## What is LINO?

LINO is a decentralized cryptocurrency representing the fundamental unit of value of the Lino Blockchain.

## What are validators and what do they do?

Lino Blockchain relies on a set of validators to secure the network. The role of a validator is to run a full node and participate in consensus by broadcasting a cryptographic signature signed by its private key. Validators verify messages and commit new blocks to the blockchain and receive message fees and Validator Rewards in return.

## How to become Validator

Running a validator requires a minimum amount of LINO Stake and technical skills. More details can be found [here](../blockchain/validator.html).

## How to participate in Lino Blockchain governance system?

Any LINO Stake holders can participate in the governance system.

## What are LINO Stake? (How to stake in & stake out & claim rewards)

LINO Stake(LS) holders are the owners of Lino Network. LS holders can receive Voting Rewards by voting for the blockchain updates and validator election.

LINO Stake is a staking feature of LINO. By Staking in your LINO, your can convert LINO to LINO Stake immediately. However, it takes 12 weeks, called the Pending Period, to stake out your LS back to LINO completely. During the Pending Period, 1/12 of your LS will be converted LINO each week.

## What is Content Rewards and how to claim

Content Rewards are issued by the Lino blockchain to the content creators on Lino Apps.   For example, after a streamer on DLive receiving any donation on a live stream, this streamer will receive Content Rewards after 7 days. The Content Rewards will be sent to content creator's account directly. No need to claim.

## How does the transaction fee work?

Lino blockchain has a Hybrid Fee Model. All the in-app messages, such as donating IDA and creating posts, are free. However, all the wallet messages, such as transferring LINO, Staking in, Staking out, and Voting, are subject to fees. The specific amount of fee is based on the current number of messages in a block. In other words, the busier the blockchain, the higher the fee is. Normally, it won't cost more than 0.5 LINO.
