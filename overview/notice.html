In the worst scenario, this could lead to the loss of all or part of the LINO which had been purchased. IF YOU DECIDE TO PURCHASE LINO, YOU EXPRESSLY ACKNOWLEDGE, ACCEPT AND ASSUME THE FOLLOWING RISKS:</p> <ol><li><p>Uncertain Regulations and Enforcement Actions
The regulatory status of LINO and distributed ledger technology is unclear or unsettled in many jurisdictions. The regulation of virtual currencies has become a primary target of regulation in all major countries in the world. It is impossible to predict how, when or whether regulatory agencies may apply existing regulations or create new regulations with respect to such technology and its applications, including LINO and/or the Lino blockchain. Regulatory actions could negatively impact LINO and/or the Lino blockchain in various ways. The Foundation, the Distributor (or its affiliates) may cease operations in a jurisdiction in the event that regulatory actions, or changes to law or regulation, make it illegal to operate in such jurisdiction, or commercially undesirable to obtain the necessary regulatory approval(s) to operate in such jurisdiction. After consulting with a wide range of legal advisors and continuous analysis of the development and legal structure of virtual currencies, a cautious approach will be applied towards the sale of LINO. Therefore, for the token sale, the sale strategy may be constantly adjusted in order to avoid relevant legal risks as much as possible. For the token sale, the Foundation and the Distributor are working with Lex Advocatus LLC, a boutique corporate law firm in Singapore with a good reputation in the blockchain space.</p></li> <li><p>Inadequate disclosure of information
As at the date hereof, the Lino blockchain is still under development and its design concepts, consensus mechanisms, algorithms, codes, and other technical details and parameters may be constantly and frequently updated and changed. Although this white paper contains the most current information relating to the Lino blockchain, it is not absolutely complete and may still be adjusted and updated by the Lino team from time to time. The Lino team has no ability and obligation to keep holders of LINO informed of every detail (including development progress and expected milestones) regarding the project to develop the Lino blockchain, hence insufficient information disclosure is inevitable and reasonable.</p></li> <li><p>Competitors
Various types of decentralised applications and networks are emerging at a rapid rate, and the industry is increasingly competitive. It is possible that alternative networks could be established that utilise the same or similar code and protocol underlying LINO and/or the Lino blockchain and attempt to re-create similar facilities. The Lino blockchain may be required to compete with these alternative networks, which could negatively impact LINO and/or the Lino blockchain.</p></li> <li><p>Loss of Talent
The development of the Lino blockchain greatly depends on the continued co-operation of the existing technical team and expert consultants, who are highly knowledgeable and experienced in their respective sectors. The loss of any member may adversely affect the Lino blockchain or its future development. Further, stability and cohesion within the team is critical to the overall development of the Lino blockchain. There is the possibility that conflict within the team and/or departure of core personnel may occur, resulting in negative influence on the project in the future.</p></li> <li><p>Failure to develop
There is the risk that the development of the Lino blockchain will not be executed or implemented as planned, for a variety of reasons, including without limitation the event of a decline in the prices of any digital asset, virtual currency or LINO, unforeseen technical difficulties, and shortage of development funds for activities.</p></li> <li><p>Security weaknesses
Hackers or other malicious groups or organisations may attempt to interfere with LINO and/or the Lino blockchain in a variety of ways, including, but not limited to, malware attacks, denial of service attacks, consensus-based attacks, Sybil attacks, smurfing and spoofing. Furthermore, there is a risk that a third party or a member of the Foundation, the Distributor or its affiliates may intentionally or unintentionally introduce weaknesses into the core infrastructure of LINO and/or the Lino blockchain, which could negatively affect LINO and/or the Lino blockchain. Further, the future of cryptography and security innovations are highly unpredictable and advances in cryptography, or technical advances (including without limitation development of quantum computing), could present unknown risks to LINO and/or the Lino blockchain by rendering ineffective the cryptographic consensus mechanism that underpins that blockchain protocol.</p></li> <li><p>Other risks
In addition, the potential risks briefly mentioned above are not exhaustive and there are other risks (as more particularly set out in the Terms and Conditions) associated with your purchase, holding and use of LINO, including those that the Foundation or the Distributor cannot anticipate. Such risks may further materialise as unanticipated variations or combinations of the aforementioned risks. You should conduct full due diligence on the Foundation, the Distributor, its affiliates and the Lino team, as well as understand the overall framework, mission and vision for the Lino blockchain prior to purchasing LINO.</p></li></ol></div> <footer class="page-edit"><!----> <!----></footer> <div class="page-nav"><p class="inner"><!----> <span class="next"><a href="/overview/intro.html">Introduction</a>→
